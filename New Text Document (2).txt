1. Given an array of N integers.Find the second largest element in an array without sorting an array  input: [1,7,3,6,5] output : 6 Input:[6,5,1,8,7,8] Output: 7

2. write a program to print all the leaders in the array .An element is leader if it is greater than all the element to its right side .And the right most side is always a leader input1: Arr[] = {7,8,3,4,6,2} output: 8 6 2  inout 2 : Arr[] = {5,5,3,2,1} output : 5 3 2 1
